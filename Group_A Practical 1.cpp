/*Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type.
Implement the following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which
creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overload operator+ to add two complex
numbers.
3. Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers. */
